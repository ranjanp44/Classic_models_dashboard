Developed an interactive Vehicle Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales performance across various regions, vehicle types, and time periods. The dashboard provides key insights into:

Total sales trends over time (monthly/yearly).

Top-performing vehicle models by sales volume and revenue.

Regional sales distribution and performance comparison.

Customer segmentation based on preferences and purchase behavior.

KPIs such as total units sold, revenue generated, and average price.

Implemented advanced Power BI features such as slicers, drill-throughs and DAX formulas to enable real-time filtering and deeper analysis. The dashboard helps stakeholders identify market trends, optimize inventory, and make data-driven business decisions.
